> Created by Matthew Farmer

## About
'Memory Game' is a simple React application designed to test a user's memory. Users will attempt to click as many cards as possible in one game session without clicking the same card twice.

## Walkthrough

Upon arrival, the a new game session will begin automatically. The user will then begin clicking cards; after each click, the cards are shuffled. Each click that is not a duplicated click will increase the user's score by one; the user's high score will also be checked to see if the current score exceeds the recorded high score. If a card is clicked twice, the game will end, the user will be notified, and a game session will automatically begin.  

## Additional Information

### Technologies Used

This application utilizes React for its front-end and Bootstrap for its CSS framework.
